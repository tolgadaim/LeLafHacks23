# Fly Lehigh: 
## Explore and learn about the Lehigh Valley
## By Leo Chen, Tolga Daim, Sean Pandaleon, and Sinan Aksu

### Impact
Fly Lehigh is a flight simulator set in the Lehigh Valley and is meant for everybody to learn more about where they live. The
video game-esque experience of the project will offer an engaging way for Lehigh Valley residents to learn about the historic
and cultural landmarks of the area. By having users be more knowledgeable of their community, we aim to integrate and unite the 
Lehigh Valley 

### Instructions
To play Fly Lehigh, go to the repo's release section, download the game, and run it on your Windows computer.
Use the WASD keys to fly the plane, SHIFT to increase the engine power, and CTRL to decrease the engine power.
